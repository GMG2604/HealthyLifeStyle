                <h5>What is BMR?</h5>
                <p class="p4">
                    Basal metabolic rate, reffered to as BMR, is the minimum amount of energy your body needs to perform basic functions while at rest.
                    It's also known as resting metabolic rate, RMR. Measuring the energy your body needs to maintain
                    homeostasis and the energy your body needs to perform
                    basic functions like breathing, blood circulation, and body temperature. 
                    Knowing your BMR can help you understand how your body responds to life activities,
                    you can use your it to adjust your lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight and also
                    use it to determine how many calories you want to burn or consume. Our calculator can give the BMR according to the information you provide.

                <h6>What is TDEE?</h6>
                <p class="p5">
                    Total Daily Energy Expenditure, reffered to as TDEE, is the number of calories your body burns in a day. 
                    It includes the energy used for basic bodily functions, physical activity, and digestion.
                    The TDEE is affected by many aspects such as activity level which is the amount of energy you use through exercise and other daily activities.
                    High-intensity activities like running and swimming burn more calories than low-intensity activities like walking.
                    Diet, the energy required to digest and absorb nutrients from food. Protein takes more energy to digest than fat.
                    The proportion of fat-free mass such as muscle and bones, to body fat. People with more muscle mass have a higher TDEE.
                    Chronic stress can increase metabolic rate and disrupt eating and sleep patterns.

                <h6 class="h7">What are calories and what do they do?</h6>
                <p class="p6">A calorie is a unit that measures energy, specifically how much heat is required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.
                    The body converts calories from food and drinks into physical energy or stores them as fat.
                    To maintain a stable weight, the number of calories consumed should equal the number of calories used 
                    In nutrition, calories refer to the energy people get from the food and drink they consume, and the energy they use in physical activity.
                    The balance between calories in and calories out determines a person's weight. If a person eats more calories than they burn, they gain weight.
                    If they eat fewer calories than they burn, they lose weight. 
                    The number of calories in a food is a measure of how much potential energy that food can provide to the body.
                    The body needs calories to survive, without energy, the cells in the body would die, the heart and lungs would stop, and the organs would not be able to function.

                <p class="p7">What is a Calorie Deficit?</p>
                <p class="p8">
                    A calorie deficit is when you burn more calories than you consume. It's often used to lose weight. 
                    For example, if you burn 2,500 calories per day but only eat 2,000, you have a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day. 
                    Over time, this can result in weight loss. A calorie deficit can be achieved through diet, exercise, or a combination of both.
                </p>
                <p class="p9">What is a Calorie Surplus?</p>
                <p class="p10">
                    A calorie surplus is when you consume more calories than you burn. It's often used to gain weight, particularly muscle mass. 
                    For example, if you burn 2,000 calories per day but eat 2,500, you have a calorie surplus of 500 calories per day. 
                    Over time, this can result in weight gain. A calorie surplus can be achieved through diet, exercise, or a combination of both.
